I was thinking about how cool would it be to live the experience of being a hero with powers like your favorite R.P.G. and said to myself 'Lets make it!'. So this is it, an RPG where you are the hero and must defeat the monsters, level up, become more powerfull and live the experience of being the most powerful in the universe.
