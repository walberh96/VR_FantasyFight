# VR_FantasyFight
I was thinking about how cool would it be to live the experience of being a hero with powers like your favorite R.P.G. and said to myself 'Lets make it!'. So this is it, an RPG where you are the hero and must defeat the monsters, level up, become more powerfull and live the experience of being the most powerful in the universe.

# What you need
You will need a VR device to play it, it's made for the Oculus Quest 2 and Windows, but you can download the code from this repo and set it up yourself in Unity or any other Game Engine.

# Where to download
This is only a personal project for my own use and very easy to set up, so if you want my version just download my build in the releases tag and play it.
